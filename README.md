# **Bare Soil Index (BSI) Plugin for QGIS**

This plugin provides a user-friendly interface for calculating and visualizing the Bare Soil Index (BSI) within Quantum GIS. 
By leveraging multispectral satellite imagery, users can quickly and accurately assess the extent of bare soil areas. 
The plugin supports various Bands indices as input for BSI calculation and offers customizable visualization options. 
It is built using Python and integrates popular image processing libraries

With a simple and intuitive interface, users can easily calculate and visualize BSI values. 
Key features include support for multiple satellite imagery formats, customizable BSI calculation parameters, and flexible output options. 
The plugin is designed to be user-friendly, requiring minimal coding experience
Users can customize the BSI calculation parameters to suit their specific needs.

This plugin has been tested with QGIS version 3.38.3 and is compatible with all operating systems

The 'Input Parameters' panel (Figure 2) allows users to specify various input parameters, such as the input raster, the desired vegetation indices, and the calculation method.

### Workflow
To calculate the Bare Soil Index, simply:
1. Load your input raster.
2. Select the desired vegetation indices.
3. Click the 'Calculate' button. 
The results will be displayed in a new raster layer.
